## Development Environment Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```
   Coordinate with your team lead for repository access
   ```

2. **Set Up D365FO Development Environment**

## Contribution Process

### Before You Start

1. **Check Existing Issues**: Review existing work items or issues
2. **Discuss Major Changes**: For significant changes, discuss with the team first
3. **Create a Work Item**: Ensure there's a tracking item for your work
4. **Assign Yourself**: Let others know you're working on it

### Making Changes

1. **Create a Branch**
   ```
   Use a descriptive branch name: feature/claim-workflow-improvement
   ```

2. **Make Your Changes**
   - Keep changes focused and atomic
   - Follow coding standards
   - Write clear commit messages

3. **Test Thoroughly**
   - Unit test your code
   - Perform integration testing
   - Test all affected workflows

4. **Document Your Changes**
   - Update relevant documentation
   - Add inline comments for complex logic
   - Update CHANGELOG.md if applicable

## Coding Standards

### X++ Code Style

- **Naming Conventions**:
  - Classes: PascalCase (e.g., `HMClaimProcessor`)
  - Methods: camelCase (e.g., `processClaimWorkflow`)
  - Variables: camelCase (e.g., `claimId`, `patientName`)
  - Constants: UPPER_CASE (e.g., `MAX_RETRY_COUNT`)
  - Tables: PascalCase with HM prefix (e.g., `HMClaimTable`)

- **Code Organization**:
  - Keep methods focused and single-purpose
  - Limit method length (ideally < 50 lines)
  - Use meaningful variable names
  - Avoid deep nesting (max 3-4 levels)

- **Comments**:
  - Use XML documentation for public methods
  - Add inline comments for complex business logic
  - Explain "why" not "what" in comments
  - Keep comments up-to-date with code changes

### Metadata Standards

- **Tables**:
  - Use appropriate table groups
  - Define proper indexes
  - Set delete actions correctly
  - Add developer documentation

- **Forms**:
  - Follow D365FO form patterns
  - Maintain consistent user experience
  - Implement proper data sources
  - Add help text for fields

- **Security**:
  - Define privileges with appropriate access levels
  - Group privileges into duties logically
  - Assign duties to roles appropriately
  - Follow least privilege principle

## Best Practices

### D365FO Best Practices

1. **Always Run Best Practice Checks**
   - Before committing code
   - Fix all errors and warnings
   - Document suppressions if necessary

2. **Database Operations**
   - Use set-based operations when possible
   - Avoid ttsbegin/ttscommit in loops
   - Implement proper error handling
   - Use RecordSortedList or RecordInsertList for bulk operations

3. **Performance**
   - Optimize queries with proper indexes
   - Avoid select * statements
   - Use query hints appropriately
   - Profile code for performance issues

4. **Error Handling**
   - Use try-catch blocks appropriately
   - Provide meaningful error messages
   - Log errors for troubleshooting
   - Never suppress errors silently

### Healthcare-Specific Considerations

- **HIPAA Compliance**:
  - Never log PHI in debug statements
  - Implement proper access controls
  - Use encryption for sensitive data
  - Follow data minimization principles

- **Audit Requirements**:
  - Log all data modifications
  - Track user actions on sensitive records
  - Maintain audit trails

## Testing Guidelines

### Unit Testing

- Write unit tests for business logic
- Test edge cases and boundary conditions
- Mock external dependencies
- Aim for high code coverage

### Integration Testing

- Test complete workflows end-to-end
- Verify data entity operations
- Test security role access
- Validate integration points

### Manual Testing

- Test UI forms and user interactions
- Verify reports and analytics
- Test with realistic data volumes
- Validate error messages and handling

### Test Data

- Use anonymized or synthetic data
- Never use real PHI for testing
- Create comprehensive test scenarios
- Document test data setup

## Security Guidelines

### Code Security

1. **Never Commit Secrets**
   - No API keys, passwords, or credentials in code
   - Use Key Vault for sensitive configuration
   - Review commits before pushing

2. **Input Validation**
   - Validate all user inputs
   - Sanitize data before database operations
   - Prevent SQL injection

3. **Access Control**
   - Implement proper authorization checks
   - Verify user permissions in code
   - Use D365FO security framework

### Data Security

- Implement data encryption where required
- Use secure communication protocols
- Follow data retention policies

## Documentation

### Required Documentation

1. **Code Documentation**
   - XML documentation for public APIs
