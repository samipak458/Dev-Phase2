## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

1. **Development Environment**
   - Visual Studio with D365FO development tools
   - Access to D365FO development environment
   - Git for version control
   - Understanding of X++ programming language

2. **Access Requirements**
   - Repository access (read/write permissions)
   - D365FO development environment access
   - Appropriate security clearances for healthcare data

3. **Knowledge Requirements**
   - Familiarity with D365FO development

   - Knowledge of HIPAA and healthcare compliance

### Setting Up Development Environment

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd Dev-Phase2
   ```

2. Copy MazikCare to your PackagesLocalDirectory:
   ```

   ```

3. Build the model in Visual Studio:
   - Open Visual Studio
   - Dynamics 365 > Build Models
   - Select MazikCare

## Development Process

### Branching Strategy

We follow a Git Flow-based branching strategy:

- **main**: Production-ready code
- **develop**: Integration branch for features
- **feature/**: Feature branches (e.g., feature/claim-enhancement)
- **bugfix/**: Bug fix branches (e.g., bugfix/claim-calculation-error)
- **hotfix/**: Emergency production fixes

### Creating a Branch

```bash
# For new features
git checkout -b feature/descriptive-feature-name

# For bug fixes
git checkout -b bugfix/issue-number-short-description

# For hotfixes
git checkout -b hotfix/critical-issue-description
```

### Making Changes

1. **Keep Changes Focused**
   - One feature or fix per branch
   - Make small, incremental commits
   - Write clear commit messages

2. **Commit Message Format**
   ```
   <type>: <subject>
   
   <body>
   
   <footer>
   ```
   
   Types:
   - `feat`: New feature
   - `fix`: Bug fix
   - `docs`: Documentation changes
   - `refactor`: Code refactoring
   - `test`: Adding or updating tests
   - `chore`: Maintenance tasks

   Example:
   ```
   feat: Add new claim status validation
   
   - Implement validation for claim status transitions
   - Add error messages for invalid transitions
   - Update unit tests
   
   Closes #123
   ```

## Coding Standards

### X++ Code Standards

1. **Naming Conventions**
   - Classes: `HM` prefix + PascalCase (e.g., `HMClaimProcessor`)
   - Methods: camelCase (e.g., `processClaimData`)
   - Variables: camelCase (e.g., `claimAmount`)
   - Constants: UPPER_CASE (e.g., `MAX_CLAIM_AMOUNT`)
   - Tables: `HM` prefix + PascalCase (e.g., `HMClaimTable`)

2. **Code Structure**
   ```xpp
   /// <summary>
   /// Brief description of the class
   /// </summary>
   class HMClaimProcessor
   {
       // Constants
       const int MAX_RETRY_COUNT = 3;
       
       // Member variables
       private HMClaimTable claimTable;
       
       /// <summary>
       /// Method description
       /// </summary>
       /// <param name="_claimId">Claim identifier</param>
       /// <returns>Processing result</returns>
       public boolean processClaimData(RecId _claimId)
       {
           // Method implementation
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Best Practices**
   - Always run D365FO Best Practice checker before committing
   - Handle exceptions properly with try-catch blocks
   - Use proper transaction management (ttsbegin/ttscommit)
   - Validate input parameters
   - Log errors appropriately
   - Follow the principle of least privilege for database access

4. **Performance Considerations**
   - Use set-based operations when possible
   - Avoid cursor-based operations for large datasets
   - Optimize queries with proper indexes
   - Cache frequently accessed data appropriately

### XML and Metadata

- Maintain consistent formatting
- Use proper indentation (tabs as per D365FO standard)
- Validate XML files before committing
- Don't manually edit generated metadata when possible

### Resource Files (HTML/CSS/JavaScript)

- Follow modern web standards
- Minify resources for production
- Test in supported browsers
- Document external library dependencies
